           <strong> Hello I am Pundarikaksha from Delhi, and I am in Civil Engineering Dept. I am highly interested
            in computer sciences and often engage myself in doing stuff related to CS. Other than that I like to 
            play football, also play some music and often find myself at peace while solving physics or maths. 
            I started my coding journey recently and I am looking forward to learn as much as I can about computers. I found
            the machine learning , competetive programming and web development modules highly engaging and interesting and 
            I look forward to learning more about them asap. Can't wait to be a part of coding club!
           </strong>

            coding week given the extremely tight schedule lol :p
